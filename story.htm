<p>On the outside, Hallie looks like a normal, energetic 3 year old.  However, on the inside, it is a completely different story.  She was born December 20, 2005 at 37 weeks gestation, and while technically being considered full term, she looked more like a preemie, weighing in at 4 lbs 8 oz and 17 inches long.  I was only able to hold my baby for about half an hour, when they took her from me to try and determine what was wrong with her.  Hallie was transferred by a special team to the children’s hospital in Salt Lake (where she was born) within hours of being born.  By the next afternoon, they had determined she had a bowel obstruction and began surgery to fix it.  What they found was worse than they had imagined.  She was diagnosed with a jejuna atresia—an apple core atresia to be exact.  There had been a disruption to her blood supply to her intestines and her intestines completely separated in utero.  Her small intestine end sealed off and because she kept drinking the amniotic fluid, it stretched out like a balloon.  Her large intestine end had no blood supply, so it withered up and died. They ended up removing half of her small intestine and half of her large intestine when she was 1 day old.  She remained in the NICU for 25 days, during which time the nurses noticed a heart murmur and tests were ordered in which it was determined that she had an atrial septal defect, commonly referred to as an ASD.</p>
<p>We were home only 2 weeks before she was admitted with a respiratory virus known as RSV.  Hallie spent 11 days in the hospital , during which time she contracted an intestinal infection commonly referred to as C-Dif.  Basically, the antibiotics they were using to fight her ear infections, killed off the good bacteria as well as the bad in her intestines.  This is a big problem for her because she is missing so much of her intestine, that it is very easy to disrupt the “flora” (the balance of good and bad bacteria) of her intestines.</p>
<p>Shortly after returning home with our baby, we noticed a bulge from time to time as we were changing her diaper.  If we pushed on it, it went back in, so I took her in and she was diagnosed with an inguinal hernia.  We scheduled surgery to repair it with a new surgeon because we had heard her original surgeon did not give her much hope of surviving without being TPN (nutrition through an iv) dependent.  We needed someone who would give her at least a fighting change.  Just 3 days before her scheduled surgery, Hallie’s intestines stopped working and she was rushed in for emergency surgery, this time with the surgeon who happened to be on call.  Dr. Eric Scaife found that a section of her small intestine was flopping over onto her large intestine and had created a lot of scarring.  He removed 5 inches more of her large intestine, although he wasn’t hopeful that it was going to solve her problem.</p>
<p>During this 2 week hospitalization, Hallie was scheduled for a cardiologist appointment and since they were booked so far out, I didn’t want to reschedule.  I took her for a little walk and met with the cardiologist and was given shocking news.  Based on the fact that she had a unique heart defect called an interrupted inferior vena cava with an azyguous continuation, he diagnosed her with polysplenia, a condition in which the patient has multiple spleens.  He also informed that she had an underdeveloped right lung.  As I started to research polysplenia, I was devastated.  Only 4 in 1,000,000 children are born with it.  The survival rate is not great—1 in 3 will not make it to the age of 1.  Half of those that survive that long, will not make it to the age of 15.  Major birth defects are associated with polysplenia.  Basically the spleens take up too much room while developing, and so none of the other organs develop properly.  Also, while one would think that having more than 1 spleen would be great (if 1 is good, multiple is better), the majority of polysplenic kids don’t have a functional spleen, which greatly affects their immune system.</p>
<p>Armed with these statistics, we took our daughter home, only to remain there for 2 days before her intestines stopped working again.  Hallie was admitted to the hospital again, where her doctors, led by Dr. Scaife, determined that her best chance of survival was a very new surgery, that had only been performed a few dozen times in the nation, called a Serial Transverse Enteroplasty (STEP).  They had no statistics to give us, but we chose to go ahead with this option.  However, because Hallie’s last surgery had been just 2 weeks before, the risk of causing more damage by operating again that soon was too high.  They surgically implanted a central line into her chest and got her started on TPN.  We took her home a week later, with her only being able to eat 2/3 of an ounce of formula every 3 hours.  It was all her intestines could tolerate.  The rest of her nutrition consisted of me starting at 5:00 at night, mixing up her TPN and lipids in a sterile environment, programming pumps and hooking her up by 6:00.  By 12:00 the next day, she would be done and we would get a small break from the pumps.  We did this for 6 weeks to buy her time to recover, in order to do her STEP procedure.</p>
<p>A week before she was scheduled for surgery, she ended up with a line infection and we wound up back in the hospital, on antibiotics, trying to save her central line.  We finally ended pulling the line a few days before surgery because they would not operate without the infection being under control.  On May 2, 2006, Dr. Scaife took Hallie from our arms and began the STEP procedure.  I had asked him to look at her spleens while he was in there and he found that she has 5 spleens.  Her pancreas is wrapped around her intestines, her liver is very flat and malformed.  All of this is attributed to her polysplenia.  He ended up cutting her intestines apart in 30 different places and stapling them all back together again.  In essence, he completely rebuilt her small intestines, giving her back about half of the amount she had originally lost.  It was a very hard surgery on her and caused extreme amounts of pain.  She required blood during surgery and they gave her a morphine drip to try and control the pain.  Several hours after surgery, she started itching and jerking around.  They couldn’t figure out why until she stopped breathing.  She was having an allergic reaction to the morphine.  What a scary day that was!  Once they got her breathing again, they gave Hallie some Benadryl and we quickly switched her to different pain meds.  After that, she amazed all of us.  Just 4 short days after surgery, her intestines recovered enough for her to start eating.  We left the hospital one week after surgery and she took off from there.</p>
<p>Hallie was still on TPN for another month, while her intestines completely recovered.  She had another line infection, which required another week in the hospital, but on June 1, 2006, they removed her central line.  From an intestinal stand point, she had about 2 ½ years that she did really well.  She was hospitalized in January 2007 for a respiratory virus, and then again in February of the same year for another respiratory virus.  In March 2007, we took her in and had tubes put in her ears to help with her ear infections.  We moved to Reno in September of 2007 due to my husband’s job.  In January 2008, she ended up with RSV and pneumonia and was in the hospital here for a few days on oxygen.  We were hopeful that we would only be dealing with her immune issues and the aftermath of her intestinal surgeries.</p>
<p>Shortly after Christmas 2008, Hallie started experiencing a lot of pain in her belly.  We watched her for a few weeks, wondering if she didn’t have an intestinal virus causing the pain.  After she started waking up at night in pain, I took her in to Dr. Tammy Roesler, her pediatrician here.  We did x-rays and Hallie was diagnosed with an ileus.  Basically, for whatever reason, her intestines just stopped working.  They put her on a liquid diet for the weekend, but by the next week, we ended up in the emergency room, with her in immense pain.  They gave her enemas to get things moving again, but I could still see that things were not normal for her.  Because she has so little of her intestines, she should have frequent, loose bowel movements.   She started going 48 hours in between movements.  At this point, I contacted her surgeon and GI doctor in Salt Lake.  They put her on a laxative to try and get things moving and they did for a few weeks, but by the end of February, she started going 48 hours in between bowel movements, even on the laxative.  I took her to Salt Lake in March, where she was diagnosed with a partial obstruction.  We had to wait to have surgery because she had a cold and was having an asthma-like reaction to it.  Finally, on March 23, we took her in for surgery.  Dr. Scaife went in and removed about 7 inches more of her intestines, leaving her with only 130 cm of small intestine, about half of normal.  The day after surgery, she started coughing and was quickly diagnosed with influenza and become so weak that she couldn’t even blow bubbles from a wand.  She remained in the hospital for 9 days, and then we stayed with family for a few more days before flying back to Reno.</p>
<p>Hallie had only been home for 24 hours, when her intestines stopped working.  She was admitted to St. Mary’s, where they contacted Salt Lake and decided it was in her best interest to send her back.  She was Emergency Airlifted back to Salt Lake the next day, where they took her off all food and ran a bunch of tests.  After a week in the hospital, we determined that she could not absorb enough nutrients out of her intestines, so we placed a feeding tube in her nose, got her stable and released her.   We stayed with family through the Easter weekend to make sure that she really was stable and then flew home to be with the rest of our family.</p>
<p>Two short days after returning home, she started having a lot of pain and throwing up, which are classic signs of obstructions.  She was admitted, only to find that she had contracted the rotavirus.  Because she was so malnourished from her ordeal of the last few months, she was there for 4 days while they balanced out some of her nutrition levels.  Shortly after she got home, her baby brother was admitted for the same virus, however he only had to stay 24 hours.</p>
<p>In June, we took Hallie in and had a permanent feeding tube placed, in order to make her life easier. She started having problems again in July.  We did more tests in Salt Lake and they found that a section of her intestines is slightly malrotated.  In and of itself, that is not a huge problem, but for whatever reason, her intestines just don’t want to move things through.  We have taken her off of her tube feedings and limited her beloved “milky”.  Her GI doctor is concerned that she may have a loop of her intestines sliding down inside the rest of her intestines.  He thinks it is an intermittent thing, so it will be very hard to diagnose.  We have started her on a laxative to keep things moving, but we have to be able to start her tube feedings again because she is losing weight.  She is 3 ½ and only weighs 28 lbs.  We are giving her a few weeks to see if she can tolerate the tube feedings with the laxative and then will probably have to do a contrast study done of her intestines.  They are capable of doing the test here in Reno, but they don’t like to do it on pediatric patients.  Even more, it is going to be harder to find someone to do the test on Hallie, with all of her history.  If we can’t find a radiologist to do it here, our options are either take her to Oakland, where they don’t know her, or back to Salt Lake where they have done all of her previous tests.</p>
<p>We are not sure where Hallie is going to take us the next little while.  The doctors have told us that it is not a matter of if she has another obstruction, but a matter of when.  That she will have more surgery is inevitable, it is just a matter of how much time we can buy her.  She can’t afford to lose much more of her intestines, especially where hers are as inefficient as they are.  Our options for the future include: doing more tube  feedings, which is dependent upon her tolerating them; placing her on TPN to supplement her eating and tube feeding; or eventually her becoming TPN dependent, at which point, we would look at doing a small bowel transplant.  Because TPN is so hard on the liver, it is not a long term solution, just hopefully buying time to get a transplant.  She would also need a liver transplant at that point because of the damage done to it and most likely a pancreas as well because hers wraps around the top of her intestines.  Only time will tell which of these options, or all of them, we will end up going with.</p>
