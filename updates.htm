<ul><li>April 24, 2010</li></ul>
<p>We just got back from Cincinnati yesterday. She was admitted for more tests for 3 days and then a week later, we met with her doctors for the results and a plan. We were very anxious to get Hallie out there as she was in a ton of pain. We even put her on a clear liquid diet for a few days to try and alleviate some of it. She would just lay there on the floor, refusing to move because it hurt so much.</p>
<p>Traveling with Hallie is always difficult and we seem to always be on flights with delays or other problems with her. We got to the airport 2 hours early, but our flight out of Reno was going to be delayed so much that we were going to miss our second flight. It was so frustrating because we missed one of our flights the last trip to Cincinnati as a result of them not being able to guarantee our luggage would make it with us. We had a bunch of Hallie's medical equipment and medicines in it, so we couldn't take the chance of not making it. This time we thought we would be smarter and ship everything out the day before. So here Hallie, Tucker and I are sitting in Reno, with her iv nutrition sitting at grandma and grandpa's, waiting for us. They weren't able to get us in early enough that Hallie would have been able to get hooked up to her nutrition. She has to have a full 12 hours on the TPN and we weren't able to get into Cincinnati until midnight. We didn't get to my in-laws until almost 1:00 and she had to be admitted at noon. So, she wasn't able to have her nutrition that night, which was a huge thing because she couldn't have any while she was in the hospital for tests. I was very frustrated with the airlines for not trying to accomodate her needs a little better and try to get us in earlier to a surrounding airport. There are about 5 airports within a 2 hours drive and they wouldn't even look at flying us in to them.</p>
<p>Anyways, Hallie was admitted and they started her bowel clean out. They put 1300 ml of the medicine into her stomach before anything started coming out, so she was in a ton of pain by evening time. She went down to surgery the next afternoon. What was scheduled to take 111 minutes, only took 36. I was concerned about what that meant, but the doctor said things went smoothly. She has so little of her colon left that they were able to get through it very quickly. Her colon is dilated, which could be contributing to her problems, but other than that, it looked good. They were able to place the manometery catheter to measure the pressure her intestines are able to exert. They even were able to get it part way into her small intestine, which was good. She was on a liquid diet on Wednesday and couldn't eat Thursday or the first part of Friday, which makes for some very long days. Some lady in the elevator gave her a little purse, so I started a food fund. Every time I was able to sneak out to get some food for me, I came back and put my change in her purse for her to get a snack when she could eat. I gave her a dollar when they took her back to perform the tests and she fell asleep with it in her hand. Friday, the started the manometry tests, which lasted 6 hours. It has 3 phases, the 2nd one allowing her to eat for half an hour. During the 3rd phase, they gave her medicine to encourage contractions in her intestines and it did its job well. She pushed the catheter part way out. We had some issues with the nurses and how they handled it, so I get to address that with the administrators.</p>
<p>After she was discharged, we just hung out for several days, letting her start to feel better. She was extremely irritable and ornery and mean before we left for Cincinnati and the hospital visit didn't do much for that. Sunday, she kneed me in the jaw because I was trying to get her to wear a shirt that she didn't want to. She yelled and threw a fit for 45 minutes before I was able to calm her down and I walked out with a bruised jaw. Later that day, my mother in-law was making a salad to go with dinner. Hallie looked at the vegetables she was cutting and asked," Is that vegetables? I HATE vegetables!" She threw another fit for almost an hour over this one. My patience was pretty much gone by the time Derrick flew in Wednesday night. I told him that she was his for the whole 36 hours that we were going to be there together.</p>
<p>We were able to go to the zoo, courtesy of the children's hospital, which was a nice break. She loved the animals and her little brother Tucker couldn't figure out how come there were so many "doggies" there. We visited family and got to spend time with her great grandma and a great-great aunt, as well as a visit from Derrick's cousin and her daughter that is just older than Hallie. It was nice to be able to fit some pleasure in.</p>
<p>Thursday we met with the doctors. All of her test results came back normal. It's frustrating because at this point, we know something is wrong with her, so we just want them to be able to figure it out so that we can move forward with treating her. They called in a colo-rectal surgeon to meet with us. He was great, very complimentary of how Hallie's care has been handled so far. He said that just because her results came back normal doesn't mean that they believe she is normal. What a novel concept for the medical profession. So many of the doctors that we have dealt with would have seen normal and been content to not look further.</p>
<p>They are enrolling Hallie in their intestinal rehabilitation program. We are taking her off all of her medicine, except for one (she will remain on the nutrition that she is on). She is starting on erithromycin, which helps stimulate the intestines to move faster. They think it will target the area that we think is struggling better than her other meds. She will also begin an enema regimen, getting one once a day for several months to try to teach her intestines how to function normally again. Every day next week, she will go to the hospital for x-rays to make sure that her bowels are completely emptying out and adjust the medicine as needed.</p>
<p>I am overwhelmed at the thought of what the next little while will bring. They tell me to plan on about an hour a day to do al of her meds, on top of what I already spend doing her nutrition. Add into that all of the visits to the hospital next week and it is all I am going to get done. I'm hoping that it will be worth it, but you never know with Hallie, which makes it even more overwhelming. I am very happy with the doctors. Everyone else has pretty much been closing the door, telling us there was nothing more to be done for her, that it was a miracle she has made it this far. As a parent, that is very hard to hear. So for these doctors to have a plan, and not just one, but plan A, B, and C, it is an answer to prayer.</p>
<p>We leave for Disneyworld in 2 weeks for her wish from Make a Wish. She is so excited she can hardly stand it. She keeps asking how many more "sleeps". My enthusiasm is curbed by the thoughts of how hard it is going to be to travel and for her to do something like that, as well as how to fit in an hour a day for meds, but I am hopeful. Mostly, I am just excited to have family time. We have extended family meeting us there and we are happy to get to spend time with them, but mostly we are just excited to be together with our family of 5. We have been torn apart so much the last year and a half, with me traveling with Hallie and Derrick having to work and Carson having to be in school. It will be like heaven to have all 5 of us together, enjoying something positive for a change.</p>
<p>I came back with Hallie yesterday and while it was a nice change to only travel with one child and we even had a layover in Salt Lake, so we got to see my mom for about 45 minutes, I am still missing half of my family. I missed Carson like crazy this trip and it is so good to be back home. Derrick and Tucker will be flying home tomorrow and I cannot wait for that moment, when I have my 3 kids and husband back together. Tomorrow is going to be a good day!</p>
<p>Thank you all for your continued prayers and support. Thank you for those that have called and sent messages. They help carry us through the difficult times. Thank you for those that have donated to help with Hallie's expenses. They are astronomical and keep getting worse. It is a huge help to get the donations, even the small ones. It's one less co-pay I have to come up with and that is huge right now. Thank you for those that help me care for my boys while I am with Hallie. I don't think Carson really missed me because he had so much fun with the friends he got to play with while I was gone. And Tucker, well he is going to be one sad little boy tomorrow when he has to leave his "Papa". We could not get through all of this without the incredible support system that we have. The Lord does not give us trials to face beyond our capabilities. He usually places people in our lives to help make us strong enough to deal with them. So thank you all for being a part of our lives and helping us through Hallie's journey.</p>
<p>P.S. Hallie would like to let you all know that she is going to be on the local news. We have a reporter coming out in a week and a half to interview us and hear her story. It will air in June, to help promote the golf tournament. We will make sure we get a copy and post it.</p>

<p>What a journey we have been on the last few weeks. It's literally been a roller coaster, full of ups and downs. Hallie had surgery to place her port in her chest 2 1/2 weeks ago. This was to replace her central line that broke. She came running in to me with blood running down her tummy, screaming when it broke. We were able to get it patched and left 2 days later for Salt Lake. The port was supposed to be a fairly simple surgery, but nothing is ever simple with Hallie. When her surgeon finally came out, he looked at us, shaking his head and said that he had forgotten how complex she is. None of her blood vessels route back to the heart normally. It makes placing these lines difficult because it is really a matter of trial and error. They had to try 3 times to get it in the right place and she lost a lot of blood in the process. We were anticipating her going home a few hours after surgery. 8 hours later, she was still struggling with pain and her oxygen levels. We were on the verge of admitting her, even though they had no open beds. She would have had to stay in recovery overnight. Luckily, they decided that she wasn't take deep enough breaths because of the pain. She is allergic to almost all narcotics, so we are very hesitant to give her much of anything. They finally decided that the risk of her getting RSV or whatever else was floating around the hospital outweighed the risk of sending her home with her oxygen being borderline. So off we went. She was hurting so much, it was hearbreaking. That is until her cousins brought her brothers home and then all of a sudden she could get off of my mom's couch and wanted to play. This has been her way since she was little. We can't do much pain medicine but when she is in a social environment, she is able to block out everything and just be the social butterfly she would like to be.</p>
<p>While we spent the day at the hospital, I had a very open conversation with her surgeon. He basically told me that it is a miracle that she is still here. Her intestines were broken when she was born and they are still broken. There is no magical cure and even a transplant is extremely risky. He personally doesn't know of any survivors. This is as good as she is going to get in his opinion. It was very heartbreaking to hear. I don't think he told us anything that we didn't already know, but to have a doctor that knows your child as well as he does, spell it out in black and white, it is a tough reality to face. </p>
<p>Her doctors at Stanford have told us that there isn't any more they can do for her, other than pain management and taking her off all food and having her be 100% dependent on outside nutrition. At this point, that is not even an option for us to consider. She has fought so hard that I can't give up and not continue to fight with her.</p>
<p>Needless to say, we will not be returning to Stanford. We got in touch with another GI doctor in Salt Lake that we had seen when she was a baby. She has agreed to take Hallie on and ordered more tests for while we were there. The stuck a tube down her nose into her intestines, with the intent of putting contrast into her. Keep in mind that she is completely awake while they do this. It is very unpleasant and difficult to watch as a parent under normal circumstances. Of course Hallie didn't do it the normal way and her intestines completely rejected the tube. They couldn't get it in more than an inch or two after trying for 45 minutes. They tried to push some water through to see what her gut would do with it and she immediately threw everything up. The consulted with her doctors and decided to put 400ml through her feeding tube over 2 hours. This is a ton of fluid for her to process in such a short time and she was hurting so much! Mickey Mouse was at the hospital and we put her in a wagon to go see him. She didn't even care. She has developed a new coping technique where it is like she puts a wall between her conciousness and goes somewhere else. As a parent, it is extremely difficult to watch her do this. She just checks out and goes somewhere else. You ask her a question and it can take upward of a minute for her to process and respond, if she does at all. She did this both the day of her surgery and the day of her tests. For her sake, I am glad that she can do it and not have to feel all of the pain, but as a parent, it is incredibly difficult to watch. I thought that they had overmedicated her, but when she did it again with no meds, I knew that she was learning how to do it on her own.</p>
<p>Anyways, Hallie got almost all of the fluid in and then threw it up. They decided to go ahead with the scan and hope for the best. We are still trying to figure out what the scan really shows. The radiologist feels like there is a build up of scar tissue along all 30+ incisions in her small intestine. The scare tissue is not necessarily blocking the intestines, just not allowing it to move properly. Her surgeon feels like it looks about the same as the one that she had done last year and he is not worried about it.</p>
<p>It's so frustrating to try and figure out who to listen to and where to go from here. My gut instinct is that the radiologist is right. I've talked to Cincinnati about it and they have arranged for her to come back to see them next month. She will be admitted for 3 days for further testing, in hopes of confirming what the radiologist saw. We will have to remain in Cincinnati for 11 days so that we can let the doctors review the results and meet with us. We are anxious to get there, even though it will only be Hallie, Tucker and I. Derrick and Carson will be remaining behind, although Derrick is hoping to be able to come out for the last few days to meet with the doctors.</p>
<p>As Hallie's expenses are growing exponentially, it is so important for her golf tournament to be a huge success. If any of you have contacts that would be willing to sponsor or know people who are golfers, please give them the information about her tournament. The registration form as well as a letter are on her website www.helpinghallie.com.</p>
<p>We have also had quite a few people ask us if we are doing the yard sale again this year. The answer is probably, but we will be doing it differently. It was far to large to do at our house, so we are looking for somewhere else for us to host it at. It could be a warehouse, a store front, a church, anywhere with a large space that we could go in on a Monday, set up tables and clothing racks, have people donate items all week in which we will sort, price, and put out. That way, come the day of the sale (Friday and Saturday), it is all ready to go. If any you know of a place that we could hold it at, please let me know.</p>
<p>Thank you all for your kind words and especially for those that are stepping up and helping with my boys. It means the world to me to have them taken care of while I am dealing with Hallie.</p>

<p>Life has been chaos the last few months. We moved and very happy to be settled into our new house. It makes caring for Hallie so much easier! Her medical supplies are organized and easy to find and it is so much easier to keep germ free so that she doesn't get sick.</p>
<p>I live at the doctors anymore. That or the pharmacy. Our 18 month old little boy had his adenoids out on Monday, so we are really hoping that cuts down on some of our visits. Hallie has been wheezing for almost 4 months now. We have tried everything. We can get it to clear up, but we can't get it to stay clear. We get to go see an asthma/allergy doctor in a few hours. She gets to have an allergy test done and we are hoping to figure out what is causing all of this.</p>
<p>We took Hallie to Stanford a few weeks ago and were not pleased with what they could do for her. They basically told us that there wasn't anything else they could do for her. They can try and control her pain through accupuncture, hypnotherapy, and psychotherapy, but there might come a time when we would want to take her off all food and put her 100% on TPN. It was extremely difficult to hear, especially when I have other doctors telling me that we still have options, so we will not be taking her back to Stanford. Our mindset has changed from what can we do to help her to we can't live with regrets. I can't look back down the road and wonder if we had continued to look for treatment options, if it would have made a difference in the outcome.</p>
<p>Cincinnati has sent her case to their surgery department to have them review. They told me they hoped I wasn't upset by including more people in her team. I told them the more the merrier. If they can come up with an idea of how to help her, I would be thrilled. They are trying to figure out if there is anything that they can do for her that would warrant us heading back out there. I am so impressed that they are willing to continue looking for options and answers for us, even though they really aren't getting paid for it. They are driven by the challenge and I am so appreciative of it!</p>
<p>In some ways, Hallie has improved a little. She no longer has the constant headaches and her belly pain is no longer constant either. She has her moments when she can be the normal 4 year old little girl that we wish she could be. In other ways, she has gotten worse. I'm not sure if she is on too much medicine, if she is just trying to assert her control over our lives, or if there is something more going on. She has started to have accidents again, which she hasn't had in well over a year. It is pretty much every day. As parents, we are so frustrated because we thought we were past this. Logically, I know that she has so many things going on that I shouldn't expect so much of her. Realistically, it adds more stress to my day. Yesterday, she threw up because her belly was hurting so much and it just breaks my heart that we can't seem to resolve this.</p>
<p>We are heading to Salt Lake this weekend. My husband has to work there, so we are tagging along to see family and doctors. We will be meeting with a new GI doctor there, in hopes of finding someone a little closer to us that is willing to fight for Hallie. If there ever were an emergency, Cincinnati is just too far away for us to get her to in time. She will also be having surgery while we are there. Her central line broke last week and needs to be replaced. Since we were already going to be there and the line is still functional, we decided to have her surgeon in Salt Lake perform the operation. They wil take out her old one and put a port in its place. A port is completely under the skin, so it will give her more of a normal life, allowing her to bathe and swim. We have to access it with a needle, which I am not looking forward to, but it will give her skin a break, which should help with her tape allergy. She will have her port accessed and a line attached Sunday night through Friday morning, but will have Friday, Saturday, and Sunday to be free as she calls it. We are hoping that it makes her life a little bit better.</p>
<p>The Helping Hallie Golf Tournament is moving forward. It is July 17 at 1:30. The registration forms are up on the <a href="events.htm">Events</a> page. We are looking for sponsors, donations of items to auction off, and golfers. If you know of anyone that would be willing to help us out, please forward the information on! Thank you all so much for your continued support.</p>

<li>Cincinnati Update
<ul><li>January 15, 2010</li></ul>
<p>I know a lot of you are wondering how our trip to Cincinnati went.  Thank you all for the encouragement and support as we were out there.  The trip was really long and hard.  We spent the first week meeting with doctors, getting x-rays, a barium enema, as well as lab work.  I had forgotten how nice it is to be at a children's hospital!  The day of her enema, we had a child life specialist meet us and she treated Hallie like royalty.  She even let her choose a movie to watch in a portable DVD player during the procedure.  What a great idea!  I am going to have to remember that for when we have to do procedures here in Reno.  Child life even gave us passes to go to the museum center, which consists of the History Museum, Natural History Museum, and Children's Museum.  We were able to spend the day there the day before Derrick and Carson (our 7 year old) had to head back home.</p>
<p>It's really emotional knowing that you are taking your child across the country to admit her, not knowing exactly what to expect.  It was hard on Hallie to travel that far and a huge eye opener for us to really see her limitations.  I am getting really good at having a Ziploc bag ready to catch her when she is throwing up.  We had to take her off of her medicine for a week to be able to really see what her intestines are capable of.  At first, she did better than we had expected, but the last few days were really rough.  She threw up so many times and was in so much pain.</p>
<p>We are very impressed with the doctors.  They have an entire GI wing in the hospital, which is great because even the nurses were familiar with her problems and were able to give us some insight.  I was impressed with the way they had studied Hallie's case.  It took us a month to get all of her medical records out there and was a pain, but well worth it.  There is a team of 15 doctors, nurse practitioners, and dieticians that have all studied her case and we met quite a few of them.  They would come into her hospital room and ask all sorts of questions, pertaining to their specialty.  They really knew their stuff.  I felt like while they are still trying to figure her out, they had a very good grasp of why she does what she does and what direction to head in.</p>
<p>So far, all of her test results have come back normal.  In a way it is frustrating because I know there are problems and the first doctor I talked to made it seem like because there were no issues found in the areas they tested, the rest were just fine.  I cried.  Her issues are more toward the middle of her intestines, where they weren't able to get the catheter.  After talking to one of her main doctors, he reassured me that isn't the case with her, that with her history, they were just trying to see how far up the damage went.  He is recommending that we start her on a different drug that targets more the large intestine.  We are hoping to see some improvement.  We will also be playing with her diet to try and find a good balance between what she eats, what she gets through her feeding tube and what she gets through her central line.</p>
<p>I think the best short term benefit for us is that they helped us find tape and dressings that Hallie is not allergic to.  Changing her dressing has gone from being a nightmare, to a minor inconvenience, which is so nice!</p>
<p>Hallie has had a cough for about 8 weeks now.  We have treated her for sinus infection, RSV, tested for pneumonia, given her steroids, pretty much everything we could think of.  We ended up at our pediatrician's right after we got back and she thinks Hallie has reflux, which is causing the coughing.  It's been a pretty rough week because the more she coughs, the more she throws up.  The more she throws up, the more acid comes up and causes her to cough more.  We have started her on prevacid and are hoping for the best.  Her poor little body is just tired and hurts all over because of this.  I am more than tired of coughing since Derrick ended up with bronchitis while we were out there and Tucker (our 1 year old) ended up with double ear infection and sinus infection.  He has now moved on to chronic rhinitis and he may end up with tonsils and adenoids being removed when he gets a little older.  I told them that I was going to move to our new house by myself and if they weren't healthy, they could stay at the old house.  None of them were big fans of that idea.</p>
<p>We begin moving today and hope that it will be the beginning of many good changes in our lives.  I have started organizing a golf tournament for Hallie for the summer, although I have no clue what I am doing, so if any of you have any suggestions or ideas, I am more than open to them.  It will be a learning experience, but I am very excited to see what it will bring.</p>
<p>You are all incredible.  Your words of support and encouragement mean so much.  When I get discouraged or frustrated, I go back and read them and it really helps me remember that we can do this and we will be better because of it.  Thank you, thank you, thank you!</p>
</li>

<li>Happy Birthday Hallie!
<ul><li>December 20, 2009</li></ul>
<p>Hallie is a big 4 years old today!  Wow!  Little did we know 4 years ago as we went to the hospital what a difficult journey lay ahead of us, but we wouldn't trade it for anything.  Hallie has taught us so much .  She is so brave and so strong.  She has the best attitude about everything, even to the point that she now is holding her own nebulizer mask (she has RSV right now) and wants to help with as much of her medicine as possible.  She is so grateful for everything.  Yesterday we celebrated Christmas early and she just thanking us for everything and telling us how "wonderful" it all was. There is rarely a day that goes by that I don't hear this little "I love you, Mommy" followed by "How many times have I told you that I love you".  She prompts tme to tell me how much I love her and that I am proud of her.  She is so quick to see the silver lining in her life.</p>
<p>I hope each and every one of us can learn a little something from Hallie, especially this time of year.  She didn't come into this world with these problems without a purpose.  She has reached out and touched so many people, and I hope that she can continue to reach out and touch so many more.</p>
<p>We leave in the morning for Cincinnati.  I am not looking forward to traveling with her-- it is a major undertaking in and of itself.  But we are so anxious to get her to the doctors out there.  She has been hurting so much and her intestines are just tired. There are days that she is throwing up because nothing is moving through.  There are days that she is just crying because she hurts.  She will go in on the 29th and have lab work as well as a barium enema (her bum medicine as she calls it).  We will get to meet with both Dr. Mezoff and Dr. Kaul on the 30th.  She will be admitted on January 4th and put under general anesthesia at 6:30.  They will do an endoscopy and then take out her feeding  tube in her belly and use the opening to insert wires down into her small intestine.  These have to remain in for 24 hours and will record the pressure her intestines are exerting to push food through.  It will hopefully give us an idea of how bad off her intestines really are.  She should be discharged the afternoon of the 5th.</p>
<p>Please keep her in your prayers.  We really need to find answers and this is a difficult trip to make with her in her condition.  She has to go off all of her meds a week before she is admitted so between Christmas and New Year's is going to be rough.  We are just hoping and praying that in the end, it will be worth it and we will at least have some direction of where to go with her.</p>
<p>Thank you for all of your kind thoughts and words of support.  This has been a very difficult year for us and we get to start the new year out by moving. The owner of the house we are living in lost his job and is having to short sell it.  We have found a new house about 5 miles north of us, which we are excited about.  We can begin moving in the middle of January, but will have to pay double rent through February, which is when our lease is up.  We just feel it is so important to get Hallie out of our current house and away from all of the prospective buyers that will be bringing who knows what germs into our home.  In the end, it will be a good change I think and help us expand our support system.  That's the way I have to look at it-- we are lsoing friends and neighbors, we are gaining the opportunity to add to the ones we already have.</p>
<p>We hope each and every one of you has a Merry Christmas and takes time to reflect on what the holidays this time of year really mean.  They will never be the same for us since we spent Christmas 4 years ago in the hospital.  Tell your family and friends how much they mean to you.  Don't miss an opportunity to help those in need, even if it is just with a smile to someone that is looking a little down.  Kind words and a smile are sometimes all people need to get through a rough day.  You are all incredible and we appreciate so much all you do and your love and concern for Hallie and our family.</p>

<p>Just thought I would give you a quick Hallie update.  We took her to Stanford last month adn they have taken over her care as her primary doctors.  We have been pleased with their care so far.  I talk to her doctor at least once a week, making adjustments to her medication and dealing with all of her fun little problems.  She's developed an allergy to tape, which makes life a lot more complicated, but we have adjusted and are moving forward.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, she is losing weight right now and is having a hard time keep her bowels moving things through, despite the fact that have have increased her TPN (nutrition through her iv).  We are taking her to Cincinnati Children's in a few weeks.  Their GI department was named America's Best Doctors in 2008, so we are very exctied to work with them.  So far, we have been very impressed and hopeful that they will be able to give us a positive direction to head in.  She will have a handful of tests done while we are out there and then we will meet with 2 of their specialists.  One deals specifically with motility (the intestines moving food through) while the other one focuses on kids with short bowel syndrom and kids that are technologically dependent.  We feel like it is a good fit and are anxious to meet with them.</p>
<p>On to the good news.  Hallie has been approved for a wish from Make a Wish, so we will be heading to Disney World hopefully sometime in the late spring to early summer.  We are so excited about this!  From what we have heard, it will be a once in a life time trip, with them catering to her every want and need.  The thought of a relaxing vacation, where they take care of all of her medical needs while we are there is so exciting.  We will get to stay in the Give Kids the World village on Disney property.  It is a 51 acre village whith so many incredible things in and of itself.  From what I have heard from other families that have stayed there, they could have spent the whole week in the village itself.  We can hardly wait to get there!</p>
<p>We also have heard from a player of the Cincinnati Bengals that he wants to meet Hallie, so he has gotten us tickets to a game while we are out there, as well as a VIP box to sit in so that she doesn't have to be in the cold and exposed to all of the germs.  They keep telling us this is going to be bigger than we can imagine, so we are anxious to get out there and see exactly what that means.</p>
<p>Add all of this to the fact that we have a few companies that have adopted Hallie as their Christmas project, we are thrilled with the possibilities before us.  Thank you all for your ongoing love and support.  When we started down this road almost 4 years ago with Hallie (yes, her birthday is in a few weeks-- there were so many times that we didn't think we would get to this birthday, so we are thrilled!) we didn't realize how long and hard it would be.  It has been the most challenging thing I have ever faced.  Add to that the fact that we don't live by any family, it has been a struggle.  We appreciate all of you so much, even the ones we have never met.  Your words of support and encouragement give us the strength to keep moving forward.  We hope all of you have a very happy holiday season. Christmas has a very different meaning for us since Hallie was born and spent her first Christmas in the hospital, fighting for her life.  Cherish your family and friends and the precious moments that you have with them!  Thank you all, once again.</p>

<p>We have started reaching out to other hospitals in an attempt to figure out what is wrong with Miss Hallie.  We have researched for weeks and narrowed it down to Stanford and Cincinnati.  We chose bowel transplant programs, not because she is a candidate at this point, but for the fact that they see the worst of the worst and can hopefully help  us determine what is causing all of Hallie’s pain and motility problems.</p>
<p>Monday, we met with Stanford’s GI doctors for the first time.  They haven’t received all of her records and x-rays yet, so in a way it was frustrating because we are ready for action.  We are tired of the waiting game.  They increased her dose of one medicine and are putting her on an antibiotic to help ward off a bacterial overgrowth.  It sounds like she will go on an antibiotic for 2 weeks, and then off for 2 weeks, and then back on, until they figure out how to get her bowels working better.  They will see her back in 1 month.  I want to pull my hair out that we have to wait that long to see them again, but at the same time, I understand that they don’t want to repeat any tests that they don’t have to.</p>
<p>They did find a sacral dimple, which could be an indicator of a nerve problem.  When we head back, they want to do a CT scan of her back and see if she has a tethered spinal cord.  At first, that idea made no sense to me.  What does her spinal cord have to do with her intestines?  Then as they started explaining that as she grows, those nerves get pulled tighter and tighter so that it is hard for the body to receive the right message that the brain sends.  They asked if she had bladder problems or was clumsy.  We said no, but later when we were talking, we remembered how hard it has been for Hallie to learn how to control her bladder.  She could have been potty trained at least a year earlier if we didn’t have to worry about that.  So, the more we think about it, the more it seems to fit.  I am not pinning all of my hopes on this diagnosis, but we are  hopeful.  It would require neurosurgery to fix it, but for the first time ever, a surgery might could actually solve her problems, not just manage the damage being done.</p>
<p>They also had some other tests they want to do, including a manometry test, which tests the pressure her lower intestines exert.  There are some different drugs they brought up, that target more specific parts of the intestines than the ones she is on, so we may be changing up her drug regimen as well.  In all, we are very hopeful that we are on the right track finally.  We are still pursuing going to Cincinnati’s Children’s Hospital and are working with them to get all of Hallie’s medical records so that when we get out there, they will have everything that they need to help pinpoint the problems.  Hope is a pretty powerful drug and for now, we are very happy to have been given some of it!</p>

<li>Here we go again
<ul><li>September 17, 2009</li></ul>
<p>Hallie is currently sitting in a hospital bed, painting a magic wand, while we wait for surgery later today. She is wearing her Helping Hallie t-shirt and watching Cinderella. She was supposed to have surgery early this morning, so they admitted her last night, but due to a few miscommunications, she will be going in at 6:00 tonight. So far, it's been a really long day, trying to get her to understand why she still can't have anything to eat.</p>
<p>They will be surgically implanting a central line into her chest. It will empty right above her heart so that they can begin giving her TPN throughout. TPN is basically nutrition through an iv. It is really hard on the veins, though, and since hers are so fragile to begin with, the long term solution is the central line.</p>
<p>She has been having a lot of problems with her intestines the last few months, so the hope is that by bypassing the digestive system and putting some of her nutrients into her bloodstream, it will allow her intestines to rest and hopefully start functioning more effeciently.</p>
<p>Hallie will still continue to use her feeding tube in her stomach 4 days a week, but the other 3 days, she will be hooked up for 12 hours to the TPN at night. This is just a starting point, until we figure out how her body will respond to this treatment and make the necessary adjustments.</p>
<p>This means no swimming for Hallie, no baths (sponge baths are going to be our main means of keeping her clean). It means 2 more pumps to add to her iv pole, and another scar on her chest. Hopefully, 12 hours a day will be enough because when she was on it before, we were doing it 18 hours a day, which means we get to tote everything around in a back pack to provide us with some time away from home. What this means for me is being extremely vigilant to make sure that everything is clean and sterilized before and after hooking her up. She is very susceptible to line infections, so I will be scrubbing everything before mixing the TPN and making sure every nook and cranny on the port is clean before hooking her up. It also means that I will get to be mixing her TPN at night. Once mixed, it is only good for 24 hours, so the home health company will be delivering the bags without some of the ingredients, so that I can get a week's worth at a time. We were given a mini fridge at the yard sale that we chose to keep in order to have a place to keep her medicine separate from our food and daily use. All of it will have to be refrigerated. She will also be put on lipids, which is basically her main source of fat. Hopefully, she will start to gain weight again and regain some of her energy.</p>
<p>Hallie will be in the hospital over night as they start her on the TPN and make sure that she tolerates it. Tomorrow, I will get a crash refresher course in how to care for everything at home and her first delivery of medicine should arrive in the afternoon.</p>
<p>We have also opted to switch her from the Pediasure to a formula where the nutrients are broken down, so that it is easier for her to digest. Unfortunately, it is not available in Reno, so we will have to have it shipped in.</p>
<p>She will also be starting an a probiotic. It will encourage good bacteria to grow in her intestines, to try and combat the overgrowth of bacteria there. The overgrowth is essentially like putting yeast in a balloon with a little sugar and water. As the bacteria multiplies, it starts to stretch out her intestines and causes them to not be able to function as well. We hope to get that under control to help ease some of her pain.</p>
<p>Please keep Hallie in your thoughts and prayers the next few days as we adjust to this new twist in her life. Our lives will be changing to accomodate her needs and everyone of us in our family will be effected. If you have not had a chance, please check out her website. We very much need to raise more money in order to meet her new expenses. Thank you all for your love and support. It is what is getting us through all of this-- the Lord is answering our prayers through you.</p>

<li>What a Success!
<ul><li>September 5, 2009</li></ul>
<p>Thank you all to your incredible support in helping us get the word out
about our benefit yard sale that we did for Hallie. What started as a small
thing to maybe earn enough money to take her back to Salt Lake for some tests
turned into something more than we could ever have dreamed of! We are just
finishing up loading the tables and everything that my husband's company lent
us (thank you Freeman!). It has been a long month of sorting, organizing, and
pricing, as well as living with all of the donations in my house and garage,
but well worth it in the end. We surpassed our goals time and time again. So
thank you to everyone for your help and support!</p>
<p>We have had many people ask us how we managed to pull something of this
magnitude off and I had to tell them that we have an incredible support
system. From those that have donated financially, to those that have donated
items for us to sell, as well as those that have donated their time, and for
those that have sent us kind words that have lifted our spirits that day--
THANK YOU! YOU ARE THE BEST!</p>
