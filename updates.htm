<li>Cincinnatit Update
<ul><li>January 15, 2010</li></ul>
<p>I know a lot of you are wondering how our trip to Cincinnati went.  Thank you all for the encouragement and support as we were out there.  The trip was really long and hard.  We spent the first week meeting with doctors, getting x-rays, a barium enema, as well as lab work.  I had forgotten how nice it is to be at a children's hospital!  The day of her enema, we had a child life specialist meet us and she treated Hallie like royalty.  She even let her choose a movie to watch in a portable DVD player during the procedure.  What a great idea!  I am going to have to remember that for when we have to do procedures here in Reno.  Child life even gave us passes to go to the museum center, which consists of the History Museum, Natural History Museum, and Children's Museum.  We were able to spend the day there the day before Derrick and Carson (our 7 year old) had to head back home.</p>
<p>It's really emotional knowing that you are taking your child across the country to admit her, not knowing exactly what to expect.  It was hard on Hallie to travel that far and a huge eye opener for us to really see her limitations.  I am getting really good at having a Ziploc bag ready to catch her when she is throwing up.  We had to take her off of her medicine for a week to be able to really see what her intestines are capable of.  At first, she did better than we had expected, but the last few days were really rough.  She threw up so many times and was in so much pain.</p>
<p>We are very impressed with the doctors.  They have an entire GI wing in the hospital, which is great because even the nurses were familiar with her problems and were able to give us some insight.  I was impressed with the way they had studied Hallie's case.  It took us a month to get all of her medical records out there and was a pain, but well worth it.  There is a team of 15 doctors, nurse practitioners, and dieticians that have all studied her case and we met quite a few of them.  They would come into her hospital room and ask all sorts of questions, pertaining to their specialty.  They really knew their stuff.  I felt like while they are still trying to figure her out, they had a very good grasp of why she does what she does and what direction to head in.</p>
<p>So far, all of her test results have come back normal.  In a way it is frustrating because I know there are problems and the first doctor I talked to made it seem like because there were no issues found in the areas they tested, the rest were just fine.  I cried.  Her issues are more toward the middle of her intestines, where they weren't able to get the catheter.  After talking to one of her main doctors, he reassured me that isn't the case with her, that with her history, they were just trying to see how far up the damage went.  He is recommending that we start her on a different drug that targets more the large intestine.  We are hoping to see some improvement.  We will also be playing with her diet to try and find a good balance between what she eats, what she gets through her feeding tube and what she gets through her central line.</p>
<p>I think the best short term benefit for us is that they helped us find tape and dressings that Hallie is not allergic to.  Changing her dressing has gone from being a nightmare, to a minor inconvenience, which is so nice!</p>
<p>Hallie has had a cough for about 8 weeks now.  We have treated her for sinus infection, RSV, tested for pneumonia, given her steroids, pretty much everything we could think of.  We ended up at our pediatrician's right after we got back and she thinks Hallie has reflux, which is causing the coughing.  It's been a pretty rough week because the more she coughs, the more she throws up.  The more she throws up, the more acid comes up and causes her to cough more.  We have started her on prevacid and are hoping for the best.  Her poor little body is just tired and hurts all over because of this.  I am more than tired of coughing since Derrick ended up with bronchitis while we were out there and Tucker (our 1 year old) ended up with double ear infection and sinus infection.  He has now moved on to chronic rhinitis and he may end up with tonsils and adenoids being removed when he gets a little older.  I told them that I was going to move to our new house by myself and if they weren't healthy, they could stay at the old house.  None of them were big fans of that idea.</p>
<p>We begin moving today and hope that it will be the beginning of many good changes in our lives.  I have started organizing a golf tournament for Hallie for the summer, although I have no clue what I am doing, so if any of you have any suggestions or ideas, I am more than open to them.  It will be a learning experience, but I am very excited to see what it will bring.</p>
<p>You are all incredible.  Your words of support and encouragement mean so much.  When I get discouraged or frustrated, I go back and read them and it really helps me remember that we can do this and we will be better because of it.  Thank you, thank you, thank you!</p>
</li>

<li>Happy Birthday Hallie!
<ul><li>December 20, 2009</li></ul>
<p>Hallie is a big 4 years old today!  Wow!  Little did we know 4 years ago as we went to the hospital what a difficult journey lay ahead of us, but we wouldn't trade it for anything.  Hallie has taught us so much .  She is so brave and so strong.  She has the best attitude about everything, even to the point that she now is holding her own nebulizer mask (she has RSV right now) and wants to help with as much of her medicine as possible.  She is so grateful for everything.  Yesterday we celebrated Christmas early and she just thanking us for everything and telling us how "wonderful" it all was. There is rarely a day that goes by that I don't hear this little "I love you, Mommy" followed by "How many times have I told you that I love you".  She prompts tme to tell me how much I love her and that I am proud of her.  She is so quick to see the silver lining in her life.</p>
<p>I hope each and every one of us can learn a little something from Hallie, especially this time of year.  She didn't come into this world with these problems without a purpose.  She has reached out and touched so many people, and I hope that she can continue to reach out and touch so many more.</p>
<p>We leave in the morning for Cincinnati.  I am not looking forward to traveling with her-- it is a major undertaking in and of itself.  But we are so anxious to get her to the doctors out there.  She has been hurting so much and her intestines are just tired. There are days that she is throwing up because nothing is moving through.  There are days that she is just crying because she hurts.  She will go in on the 29th and have lab work as well as a barium enema (her bum medicine as she calls it).  We will get to meet with both Dr. Mezoff and Dr. Kaul on the 30th.  She will be admitted on January 4th and put under general anesthesia at 6:30.  They will do an endoscopy and then take out her feeding  tube in her belly and use the opening to insert wires down into her small intestine.  These have to remain in for 24 hours and will record the pressure her intestines are exerting to push food through.  It will hopefully give us an idea of how bad off her intestines really are.  She should be discharged the afternoon of the 5th.</p>
<p>Please keep her in your prayers.  We really need to find answers and this is a difficult trip to make with her in her condition.  She has to go off all of her meds a week before she is admitted so between Christmas and New Year's is going to be rough.  We are just hoping and praying that in the end, it will be worth it and we will at least have some direction of where to go with her.</p>
<p>Thank you for all of your kind thoughts and words of support.  This has been a very difficult year for us and we get to start the new year out by moving. The owner of the house we are living in lost his job and is having to short sell it.  We have found a new house about 5 miles north of us, which we are excited about.  We can begin moving in the middle of January, but will have to pay double rent through February, which is when our lease is up.  We just feel it is so important to get Hallie out of our current house and away from all of the prospective buyers that will be bringing who knows what germs into our home.  In the end, it will be a good change I think and help us expand our support system.  That's the way I have to look at it-- we are lsoing friends and neighbors, we are gaining the opportunity to add to the ones we already have.</p>
<p>We hope each and every one of you has a Merry Christmas and takes time to reflect on what the holidays this time of year really mean.  They will never be the same for us since we spent Christmas 4 years ago in the hospital.  Tell your family and friends how much they mean to you.  Don't miss an opportunity to help those in need, even if it is just with a smile to someone that is looking a little down.  Kind words and a smile are sometimes all people need to get through a rough day.  You are all incredible and we appreciate so much all you do and your love and concern for Hallie and our family.</p>

<p>Just thought I would give you a quick Hallie update.  We took her to Stanford last month adn they have taken over her care as her primary doctors.  We have been pleased with their care so far.  I talk to her doctor at least once a week, making adjustments to her medication and dealing with all of her fun little problems.  She's developed an allergy to tape, which makes life a lot more complicated, but we have adjusted and are moving forward.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, she is losing weight right now and is having a hard time keep her bowels moving things through, despite the fact that have have increased her TPN (nutrition through her iv).  We are taking her to Cincinnati Children's in a few weeks.  Their GI department was named America's Best Doctors in 2008, so we are very exctied to work with them.  So far, we have been very impressed and hopeful that they will be able to give us a positive direction to head in.  She will have a handful of tests done while we are out there and then we will meet with 2 of their specialists.  One deals specifically with motility (the intestines moving food through) while the other one focuses on kids with short bowel syndrom and kids that are technologically dependent.  We feel like it is a good fit and are anxious to meet with them.</p>
<p>On to the good news.  Hallie has been approved for a wish from Make a Wish, so we will be heading to Disney World hopefully sometime in the late spring to early summer.  We are so excited about this!  From what we have heard, it will be a once in a life time trip, with them catering to her every want and need.  The thought of a relaxing vacation, where they take care of all of her medical needs while we are there is so exciting.  We will get to stay in the Give Kids the World village on Disney property.  It is a 51 acre village whith so many incredible things in and of itself.  From what I have heard from other families that have stayed there, they could have spent the whole week in the village itself.  We can hardly wait to get there!</p>
<p>We also have heard from a player of the Cincinnati Bengals that he wants to meet Hallie, so he has gotten us tickets to a game while we are out there, as well as a VIP box to sit in so that she doesn't have to be in the cold and exposed to all of the germs.  They keep telling us this is going to be bigger than we can imagine, so we are anxious to get out there and see exactly what that means.</p>
<p>Add all of this to the fact that we have a few companies that have adopted Hallie as their Christmas project, we are thrilled with the possibilities before us.  Thank you all for your ongoing love and support.  When we started down this road almost 4 years ago with Hallie (yes, her birthday is in a few weeks-- there were so many times that we didn't think we would get to this birthday, so we are thrilled!) we didn't realize how long and hard it would be.  It has been the most challenging thing I have ever faced.  Add to that the fact that we don't live by any family, it has been a struggle.  We appreciate all of you so much, even the ones we have never met.  Your words of support and encouragement give us the strength to keep moving forward.  We hope all of you have a very happy holiday season. Christmas has a very different meaning for us since Hallie was born and spent her first Christmas in the hospital, fighting for her life.  Cherish your family and friends and the precious moments that you have with them!  Thank you all, once again.</p>

<p>We have started reaching out to other hospitals in an attempt to figure out what is wrong with Miss Hallie.  We have researched for weeks and narrowed it down to Stanford and Cincinnati.  We chose bowel transplant programs, not because she is a candidate at this point, but for the fact that they see the worst of the worst and can hopefully help  us determine what is causing all of Hallie’s pain and motility problems.</p>
<p>Monday, we met with Stanford’s GI doctors for the first time.  They haven’t received all of her records and x-rays yet, so in a way it was frustrating because we are ready for action.  We are tired of the waiting game.  They increased her dose of one medicine and are putting her on an antibiotic to help ward off a bacterial overgrowth.  It sounds like she will go on an antibiotic for 2 weeks, and then off for 2 weeks, and then back on, until they figure out how to get her bowels working better.  They will see her back in 1 month.  I want to pull my hair out that we have to wait that long to see them again, but at the same time, I understand that they don’t want to repeat any tests that they don’t have to.</p>
<p>They did find a sacral dimple, which could be an indicator of a nerve problem.  When we head back, they want to do a CT scan of her back and see if she has a tethered spinal cord.  At first, that idea made no sense to me.  What does her spinal cord have to do with her intestines?  Then as they started explaining that as she grows, those nerves get pulled tighter and tighter so that it is hard for the body to receive the right message that the brain sends.  They asked if she had bladder problems or was clumsy.  We said no, but later when we were talking, we remembered how hard it has been for Hallie to learn how to control her bladder.  She could have been potty trained at least a year earlier if we didn’t have to worry about that.  So, the more we think about it, the more it seems to fit.  I am not pinning all of my hopes on this diagnosis, but we are  hopeful.  It would require neurosurgery to fix it, but for the first time ever, a surgery might could actually solve her problems, not just manage the damage being done.</p>
<p>They also had some other tests they want to do, including a manometry test, which tests the pressure her lower intestines exert.  There are some different drugs they brought up, that target more specific parts of the intestines than the ones she is on, so we may be changing up her drug regimen as well.  In all, we are very hopeful that we are on the right track finally.  We are still pursuing going to Cincinnati’s Children’s Hospital and are working with them to get all of Hallie’s medical records so that when we get out there, they will have everything that they need to help pinpoint the problems.  Hope is a pretty powerful drug and for now, we are very happy to have been given some of it!</p>
</li>

<li>Here we go again
<ul><li>September 17, 2009</li></ul>
<p>Hallie is currently sitting in a hospital bed, painting a magic wand, while we wait for surgery later today. She is wearing her Helping Hallie t-shirt and watching Cinderella. She was supposed to have surgery early this morning, so they admitted her last night, but due to a few miscommunications, she will be going in at 6:00 tonight. So far, it's been a really long day, trying to get her to understand why she still can't have anything to eat.</p>
<p>They will be surgically implanting a central line into her chest. It will empty right above her heart so that they can begin giving her TPN throughout. TPN is basically nutrition through an iv. It is really hard on the veins, though, and since hers are so fragile to begin with, the long term solution is the central line.</p>
<p>She has been having a lot of problems with her intestines the last few months, so the hope is that by bypassing the digestive system and putting some of her nutrients into her bloodstream, it will allow her intestines to rest and hopefully start functioning more effeciently.</p>
<p>Hallie will still continue to use her feeding tube in her stomach 4 days a week, but the other 3 days, she will be hooked up for 12 hours to the TPN at night. This is just a starting point, until we figure out how her body will respond to this treatment and make the necessary adjustments.</p>
<p>This means no swimming for Hallie, no baths (sponge baths are going to be our main means of keeping her clean). It means 2 more pumps to add to her iv pole, and another scar on her chest. Hopefully, 12 hours a day will be enough because when she was on it before, we were doing it 18 hours a day, which means we get to tote everything around in a back pack to provide us with some time away from home. What this means for me is being extremely vigilant to make sure that everything is clean and sterilized before and after hooking her up. She is very susceptible to line infections, so I will be scrubbing everything before mixing the TPN and making sure every nook and cranny on the port is clean before hooking her up. It also means that I will get to be mixing her TPN at night. Once mixed, it is only good for 24 hours, so the home health company will be delivering the bags without some of the ingredients, so that I can get a week's worth at a time. We were given a mini fridge at the yard sale that we chose to keep in order to have a place to keep her medicine separate from our food and daily use. All of it will have to be refrigerated. She will also be put on lipids, which is basically her main source of fat. Hopefully, she will start to gain weight again and regain some of her energy.</p>
<p>Hallie will be in the hospital over night as they start her on the TPN and make sure that she tolerates it. Tomorrow, I will get a crash refresher course in how to care for everything at home and her first delivery of medicine should arrive in the afternoon.</p>
<p>We have also opted to switch her from the Pediasure to a formula where the nutrients are broken down, so that it is easier for her to digest. Unfortunately, it is not available in Reno, so we will have to have it shipped in.</p>
<p>She will also be starting an a probiotic. It will encourage good bacteria to grow in her intestines, to try and combat the overgrowth of bacteria there. The overgrowth is essentially like putting yeast in a balloon with a little sugar and water. As the bacteria multiplies, it starts to stretch out her intestines and causes them to not be able to function as well. We hope to get that under control to help ease some of her pain.</p>
<p>Please keep Hallie in your thoughts and prayers the next few days as we adjust to this new twist in her life. Our lives will be changing to accomodate her needs and everyone of us in our family will be effected. If you have not had a chance, please check out her website. We very much need to raise more money in order to meet her new expenses. Thank you all for your love and support. It is what is getting us through all of this-- the Lord is answering our prayers through you.</p>
</li>

<li>What a Success!
<ul><li>September 5, 2009</li></ul>
<p>Thank you all to your incredible support in helping us get the word out
about our benefit yard sale that we did for Hallie. What started as a small
thing to maybe earn enough money to take her back to Salt Lake for some tests
turned into something more than we could ever have dreamed of! We are just
finishing up loading the tables and everything that my husband's company lent
us (thank you Freeman!). It has been a long month of sorting, organizing, and
pricing, as well as living with all of the donations in my house and garage,
but well worth it in the end. We surpassed our goals time and time again. So
thank you to everyone for your help and support!</p>
<p>We have had many people ask us how we managed to pull something of this
magnitude off and I had to tell them that we have an incredible support
system. From those that have donated financially, to those that have donated
items for us to sell, as well as those that have donated their time, and for
those that have sent us kind words that have lifted our spirits that day--
THANK YOU! YOU ARE THE BEST!</p>
