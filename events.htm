<p>We are very excited to be hosting the First Annual Helping Hallie Golf Tournament.  It will be held Saturday, July 17, 2010 at 1:30 p.m.  Mark your calendars, get your team together, and be ready to have a great time!</p>
<p>Your entry fee entitles you to play golf at the amazing Resort at Red Hawk golf course.  A big thank you to them for hosting our tournament this year.  A BBQ dinner will follow, as well as an auction and raffle.  There are many ways to help make this a huge success.  Besides golfing, you can attend the BBQ dinner, donate items for either the raffle or auction, or sponsor a hole.  There are several items that can be donated for the tournament itself.  If you are interested in donating or participating, please contact me for more information.</p>

<li>Yard Sale

<li>Friday, September 4, 2009 - 10:00am-2:00pm</li>

<p>Thank you all to your incredible support in helping us get the word out about our benefit yard sale that we did for Hallie.
What started as a small thing to maybe earn enough money to take her back to Salt Lake for some tests turned into something more than we could ever have dreamed of!
It was a long month of sorting, organizing, and pricing, as well as living with all of the donations in my house and garage,
 but well worth it in the end. We surpassed our goals time and time again. So thank you to everyone for your help and support!</p>
