<p>Hallie is a beautiful, determined, energetic little girl. She loves music and dancing. Most days can find her breaking out in a song and dance&mdash;most of which she makes up herself. She loves Hannah Montana and High School Musical and can sing most of their songs word for word. Hallie loves to color, and we own several nice pieces of her artwork throughout our house (ie. our dresser, her closet doors, the fireplace). She is very loving and is the first to say thank you for dinner or a million other random things. She has two brothers&mdash;one older and one younger&mdash;that she enjoys playing with and recently received a new puppy that she loves a little too much on occasion.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, unlike other 4 year olds, she has had to fight from birth to remain here, which is where her determination has been a huge blessing. She has beat the odds over and over. She has a very complex medical history, mostly relating to her intestines, although she does have problems with most of her other organs, including the heart, lung, liver, pancreas and spleen. She has had 13 surgeries and been hospitalized 19 times.  Hallie has a permanent feeding tube as well as a central line (a permanent iv) in order to help keep her alive.</p>
<p>Her future remains unclear, as she continues to have intestinal problems. At this point we are unsure where her condition will take us, but from the looks of things, more surgery is likely. We have had to reach out to get her the help that she desperately needs.  We travel once a month to Stanford (about 4 hours away), but Cincinnati Children's is really her best hope.  We have recently returned from a trip out there in which she was hospitalized for several days for tests.  These tests showed that there is something mechanically wrong with her intestines.  No amount of diet change will help her at this point, unfortunately.  She is on 8 different medicines to keep her intestines working and help give her the nutrition that she needs.  We have one more medicine to try before we have exhausted the medicinal options and will have to take her back to Cincinnati for further testing if it doesn't work.  At that point, we will need to involve a colo-rectal surgeon and explore what our options are from there.</p>
<p>Helping Hallie is a fund set up to raise money to help pay for expenses related to her medical care. Our monthly expenses just to keep our sweet angel alive are well into the $1,000's out of our own pocket.  When you add travel to the picture, she is one expensive little girl!  We are asking for your help as we try to figure out how to best help her.  If everyone were to donate only $10, it would make a huge difference in our ability to provide Hallie the care that she needs.</p>
