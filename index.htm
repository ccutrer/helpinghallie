<p>Hallie is a beautiful, determined, energetic  little girl.  She loves music and dancing.  Most days can find  her breaking out in a song and dance—most of which she makes up herself.  She loves Hannah Montana and High School Musical and can sing most of their songs word for word.  Hallie loves to color, and we own several nice pieces of her artwork throughout our house (ie. our dresser, her closet doors, the fireplace).  She is very loving and is the first to say thank you for dinner or a million other random things.  She has two brothers—one older and one younger—that she enjoys playing with and recently received a new puppy that she loves a little too much on occasion.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, unlike other 3 year olds, she has had to fight from birth to remain here, which is where her determination has been a huge blessing.  She has beat the odds over and over.  She has  a very complex medical history, mostly relating to her intestines, although she does have problems with most of her other organs, including the heart, lung, liver, pancreas and spleen.  She has had 10 surgeries and been hospitalized 16 times.</p>
<p>Her future remains unclear, as she continues to have intestinal problems.  At this point we are unsure where her condition will take us, but from the looks of things, more surgery is likely.  Helping Hallie is a fund set up to raise money to help pay for expenses related to her medical care.   We are asking for your help as we try to prepare for the road ahead of us.</p>
