<li>Here we go again
<ul><li>September 17, 2009</li></ul>
<p>Hallie is currently sitting in a hospital bed, painting a magic wand, while we wait for surgery later today. She is wearing her Helping Hallie t-shirt and watching Cinderella. She was supposed to have surgery early this morning, so they admitted her last night, but due to a few miscommunications, she will be going in at 6:00 tonight. So far, it's been a really long day, trying to get her to understand why she still can't have anything to eat.</p>
<p>They will be surgically implanting a central line into her chest. It will empty right above her heart so that they can begin giving her TPN throughout. TPN is basically nutrition through an iv. It is really hard on the veins, though, and since hers are so fragile to begin with, the long term solution is the central line.</p>
<p>She has been having a lot of problems with her intestines the last few months, so the hope is that by bypassing the digestive system and putting some of her nutrients into her bloodstream, it will allow her intestines to rest and hopefully start functioning more effeciently.</p>
<p>Hallie will still continue to use her feeding tube in her stomach 4 days a week, but the other 3 days, she will be hooked up for 12 hours to the TPN at night. This is just a starting point, until we figure out how her body will respond to this treatment and make the necessary adjustments.</p>
<p>This means no swimming for Hallie, no baths (sponge baths are going to be our main means of keeping her clean). It means 2 more pumps to add to her iv pole, and another scar on her chest. Hopefully, 12 hours a day will be enough because when she was on it before, we were doing it 18 hours a day, which means we get to tote everything around in a back pack to provide us with some time away from home. What this means for me is being extremely vigilant to make sure that everything is clean and sterilized before and after hooking her up. She is very susceptible to line infections, so I will be scrubbing everything before mixing the TPN and making sure every nook and cranny on the port is clean before hooking her up. It also means that I will get to be mixing her TPN at night. Once mixed, it is only good for 24 hours, so the home health company will be delivering the bags without some of the ingredients, so that I can get a week's worth at a time. We were given a mini fridge at the yard sale that we chose to keep in order to have a place to keep her medicine separate from our food and daily use. All of it will have to be refrigerated. She will also be put on lipids, which is basically her main source of fat. Hopefully, she will start to gain weight again and regain some of her energy.</p>
<p>Hallie will be in the hospital over night as they start her on the TPN and make sure that she tolerates it. Tomorrow, I will get a crash refresher course in how to care for everything at home and her first delivery of medicine should arrive in the afternoon.</p>
<p>We have also opted to switch her from the Pediasure to a formula where the nutrients are broken down, so that it is easier for her to digest. Unfortunately, it is not available in Reno, so we will have to have it shipped in.</p>
<p>She will also be starting an a probiotic. It will encourage good bacteria to grow in her intestines, to try and combat the overgrowth of bacteria there. The overgrowth is essentially like putting yeast in a balloon with a little sugar and water. As the bacteria multiplies, it starts to stretch out her intestines and causes them to not be able to function as well. We hope to get that under control to help ease some of her pain.</p>
<p>Please keep Hallie in your thoughts and prayers the next few days as we adjust to this new twist in her life. Our lives will be changing to accomodate her needs and everyone of us in our family will be effected. If you have not had a chance, please check out her website. We very much need to raise more money in order to meet her new expenses. Thank you all for your love and support. It is what is getting us through all of this-- the Lord is answering our prayers through you.</p>

<li>What a Success!
<ul><li>September 5, 2009</li></ul>
<p>Thank you all to your incredible support in helping us get the word out
about our benefit yard sale that we did for Hallie. What started as a small
thing to maybe earn enough money to take her back to Salt Lake for some tests
turned into something more than we could ever have dreamed of! We are just
finishing up loading the tables and everything that my husband's company lent
us (thank you Freeman!). It has been a long month of sorting, organizing, and
pricing, as well as living with all of the donations in my house and garage,
but well worth it in the end. We surpassed our goals time and time again. So
thank you to everyone for your help and support!</p>
<p>Channel 4 News has run a segment on Hallie throughout the week. The Reno
Gazette Journal had a <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=cache:GujOOcewvYkJ:www.rgj.com/article/20090827/NEIGHBORHOODS04/908270307/0/NEIGHBORHOODS/Saturday-yard-sale-to-benefit-sick-Sparks-girl+hallie+site:rgj.com&cd=1&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=us">small blip</a> about her as well.</p>

<p>We have had many people ask us how we managed to pull something of this
magnitude off and I had to tell them that we have an incredible support
system. From those that have donated financially, to those that have donated
items for us to sell, as well as those that have donated their time, and for
those that have sent us kind words that have lifted our spirits that day--
THANK YOU! YOU ARE THE BEST!</p>
